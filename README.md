Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

Overview
This project is designed to predict whether a given sample represents a mine or rock using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used in this project contains information related to sonar signals bounced off various objects, and the goal is to classify these objects as either a mine or not.

Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

Mine_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook script that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Sonar Data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the logistic regression model.
README.md: This file, providing details about the project and instructions on how to run it.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar Dataset, which includes data points with various signal frequencies. The labels represent two classes:

Mine (M)
Rock (R)
The features are a set of 60 frequency values that represent the energy of the sonar returns bounced off an object.

Logistic Regression Model
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used in this project to predict whether an object is a mine or not based on sonar signal data. The model is trained on the dataset, and performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data (if any)
Feature scaling (normalization)
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Model Training:

The Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set using the LogisticRegression module from Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction:

The trained model is used to predict whether a new sample belongs to the class "Mine" or "Not Mine".
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Below are the detailed evaluation metrics:

Accuracy: X%

Future Enhancements
Implementing other classification models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
Tuning hyperparameters using grid search or random search.
Visualizing the ROC curve and AUC score.
